Step 1: You are able to Write a new Program or Open the new File as well.

Step 2: Atfer writing the program programmer must save the file with appropriate extension.

Step 3: Here this s/w supports only C,C++,Java and Python language as well as you can create Text and HTML file also.

Step 4: After writing code in CommonIDE s/w you are able to click on "Compile" button.

Step 5: After Successfull Compilation you can click on "Run" button and get the output onto the "Output Screen" panel.

Step 6: But for Python language you can't compile just Run it.

  


Note: This S/W Not supports for user input and command line arguments but we can perform these task on command prompt as well. so this in not limitation of that IDE.

You are able to follow the rules for run the programs:

1)  New --> Save ---> Compile ---> Run     for  C,C++,Java language 

2)  New --> Save ---> Run     for  C,C++,Java language
